Description (Problem & Scope)
This file defines the academic goals, problem addressed, and constraints.

Problem Statement: Many individuals struggle with manually tracking and understanding their daily spending habits, often leading to poor financial decisions and unexpected budget deficits. The current lack of immediate visual feedback and the failure to distinguish between income and expenditure make existing methods tedious and ineffective for casual users.

Scope of the Project: The project scope is limited to a local, standalone desktop application that provides a centralized interface for financial tracking. It covers the complete lifecycle of a transaction (recording, visualizing, and deleting) but does not include data persistence (saving to file/database), multi-user support, or advanced features like budgeting, forecasting, or online connectivity.

Target Users:

Students needing to track monthly allowances and expenditures.

Individuals requiring a simple, visual, and immediate tool for personal budget management.

Users who need to quickly visualize their overall financial trend without needing complex accounting software.

High-Level Features:

Transaction Input Validation and Classification (Income/Expense).

Real-time Balance Calculation and Display.

Visual Reporting of Category Spending and Balance History.

Basic Delete functionality for maintenance.
