Project Title: 💸 Personal Finance Manager & Expense Tracker

Overview: This application is a desktop-based Personal Finance Manager built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to effectively track and visualize their income and expenses in real-time. The core functionality enforces a practical financial workflow by making the recording of initial Income compulsory before tracking any Expenses.

Features:

Real-time Balance: Displays the current financial balance (Income - Expenses) with dynamic color indication (green for positive, red for negative).

Mandatory Income Check: Prevents users from adding expenses until the first income transaction is recorded.

Transaction Management (CRUD): Allows adding new transactions (Income/Expense) and deleting selected transactions from the list.

Visual Summaries: Generates two distinct graphical reports using Matplotlib:

Category Breakdown (Pie Chart): Shows the distribution of expenses across different categories.

Balance History (Line Graph): Plots the cumulative financial balance over time, providing insight into spending trends.

Categorization: Separate dropdown categories for Income (Salary, Investment) and Expense (Food, Transport, Bills).

Technologies/Tools Used:

Python 3.x

Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).

Matplotlib: For generating data visualizations (Bar, Pie, and Line charts).

Pandas: For efficient data handling and calculating the running cumulative balance.
